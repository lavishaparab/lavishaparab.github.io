I am an experimental researcher specialising in phage-bacteria evolutionary interactions, 
currently employed as a postdoc in the research group of [Carolin Wendling](https://wendlinglab.owlstown.net/)
at the [Max von Pettenkofer Institut](https://www.mvp.uni-muenchen.de/), LMU Munich, Germany. Until Feb 2025, 
I worked at the [Microbial Molecular Evolution](https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/3178548/group-micromolevol) at the 
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, where I also did my PhD. I often complement my
experimental research using tools from bioinformatics and mathematical modelling. I am better found at bluesky <i class="svg-icon bluesky"></i>,

🗞️ **Updates:**
- Wrote a bsky thread for Chloramphenicol paper (add link). Converted into a blog post here (add link)
- 📜 New paper, finally out! [Chloramphenicol and gentamicin reduce the evolution of resistance to phage ΦX174 by suppressing a subset of E. coli LPS mutants](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002952) at PLOS Bio.
- 💬 Invited for a presentation at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html). Might join for a postdoc there!
- 📜 New paper: [A more significant role for insertion sequences in large-scale rearrangements in bacterial genomes](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.03052-24) at mbio.
- 📜 New pre-print: [Chloramphenicol reduces phage resistance evolution by suppressing bacterial cell surface mutants](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.28.552763v1).
- 📜 New pre-print: [Empirical evidence of a role for insertion sequences in the repair of DNA breaks in1
